Cyber Security Internship - Task 6: Password Strength Evaluation
üéØ Objective
This project fulfills Task 6 of the Elevate Labs Cyber Security Internship, which required the creation and evaluation of password strength to understand best practices and common security risks.

üß™ Methodology
The evaluation was conducted by creating multiple passwords with varying complexity and length (including simple, complex, and passphrase examples). Each password was tested using a free online password strength checker (e.g., passwordmeter.com or similar tools) to record the strength score, estimated cracking time, and specific feedback.

Key concepts like Brute Force and Dictionary attacks were researched to understand how password complexity affects real-world security.

üìä Deliverables
The primary deliverable is the detailed Report.pdf (or Report.md) which includes:

Tested Passwords: The three examples used for testing (simulated in the report for security).
Strength Results: Scores and feedback for each password.
Key Findings: A summary of best practices for strong password creation.
Security Research: Summaries of common password attacks (Brute Force, Dictionary) and the importance of complexity.
üìÅ Repository Contents
Task_6_Password_Report.pdf or Task_6_Password_Report.md: The main evaluation report with results and analysis.
Screenshots/: A folder containing screenshots of the strength checker results for the tested passwords (or simulated screenshots).
‚úÖ Key Takeaways
The evaluation reinforced that:

Length is paramount: Passphrases (15+ characters) offer vastly superior security compared to complex, shorter passwords.
Complexity is crucial: Combining uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols significantly increases the time required for a brute-force attack.
Avoid common words/patterns: Dictionary attacks exploit the use of personal information or simple word substitutions.
This task was completed as part of the Cyber Security Internship offered by Elevate Labs.




Task 6: Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength
Internship: Cyber Security Internship (Elevate Labs)

Task Objective: To understand the components of a strong password and evaluate its strength using online tools.

Tool Used: Online free password strength checker (Simulated results based on common algorithms like Zxcvbn, similar to passwordmeter.com ).

Part 1: Password Creation and Strength Evaluation
The evaluation involved creating three passwords with varying levels of complexity to test the impact of length, character variety, and common patterns.

Test Password	Characters Used	Length	Purpose of Test	Strength Score (Simulated)	Time to Crack (Simulated)	Tool Feedback / Rating
password123	Lowercase, Numbers	11	Testing an extremely common and weak password.	Very Weak (5/100)	Instantly	Feedback: Extremely common. Contains a dictionary word and sequential numbers.
P@sswOrd!2025	Mixed case, Numbers, Symbols	13	Testing a password with common word substitutions.	Fair (65/100)	Hours to Days	Feedback: Good character mix, but uses a common dictionary word with simple substitutions.
TheGreenDuckFlew@37!	Passphrase: Mixed case, Numbers, Symbols	21	Testing a long, unique passphrase.	Excellent (100/100)	Trillions of Years	Feedback: Exceptional length and variety. Highly secure against all current attacks.
Part 2: Analysis and Best Practices
A. Identification of Best Practices for Strong Password Creation
Based on the evaluation, strong passwords should use uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols, and prioritize length variations.

Prioritize Length: Passwords should be long, ideally 15 characters or more. This is the single most effective way to increase security.
Use Passphrases: Create a memorable, unique sentence or string of unrelated words that is easy for you to remember but hard for a computer to guess.
Mix Character Types: A strong password must include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
Avoid Predictable Patterns: Do not use personal information, common dictionary words, or sequential numbers/letters, as these are highly susceptible to dictionary attacks.
Use Password Managers: Utilize password managers to generate and securely store unique passwords for every account.
B. Tips Learned from the Evaluation
Common patterns fail quickly: Passwords based on simple dictionary words or recognizable patterns are cracked quickly, confirming a common mistake in password creation.
The Power of Passphrases: A strong passphrase (a longer string of words) is drastically more secure than a short, complex password.
Complexity Affects Security: Increased password complexity (length and character variety) exponentially increases the time required to crack the password, summarized as its impact on security.
Part 3: Research on Password Attacks and Security Concepts
Common Password Attacks
Brute Force Attack: This involves an attacker systematically trying every possible combination of letters, numbers, and symbols until the correct password is found.
Dictionary Attack: The attacker uses a pre-compiled list (dictionary) of common words, phrases, and previously leaked passwords to try and gain access.
Impact of Password Complexity on Security
Keyspace: Complexity, especially password length, exponentially increases the keyspace (the total number of possible combinations).
Time Cost: A larger keyspace means that a brute-force attack takes significantly more computational time, moving the time-to-crack from seconds to years or centuries, making the attack impractical.
Defense against Dictionary Attacks: Unique, long passphrases that avoid common words are not found in the dictionary files used by dictionary attacks.
Other Key Security Concepts
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): A security process that requires a user to present two or more verification factors (e.g., password + one-time code) to gain access.
Password Manager: A software application that stores and manages user's passwords in an encrypted database, helping users maintain unique, strong passwords for every account.
